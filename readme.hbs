# ember-simple-dom-tools

Absolutely untested and highly experimental.  Actually useless for the moment.

ember-simple-dom-tools is a collection of dom utilities as an alternative to jQuery.

## Use

First you install this addon

```sh
# ember-cli > 0.2.3
ember install ember-dom-simple-tools
# ember-cli <= 0.2.3
ember install:addon ember-dom-simple-tools
```

And then in your ember.js app, you can import individual modules

```js
import select from 'ember-dom-simple-tools/select';

let selectedDom = select('.content');
```

Additionally, if you wish to work with the entire lodash library on a single namespace, you have the option of importing that as well

```js
import _ from 'lodash';

let truncatedString = _.trunc(rawString);
```

It is also possible to import individual modules

```js
import { trunc } from 'lodash';

let truncatedString = trunc(rawString);
```
